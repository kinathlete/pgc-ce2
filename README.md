# PROJECT GREEN CLOUD - CO2 ESTIMATOR

The CO2 Estimator is a Streamlit app that takes cloud usage data
from AWS as input and looks up the relevant factors to calculate
the respective carbon emissions. This is only an MVP and limited
to a test data set for now.

A user can see the estimated emissions as per the current cloud
usage profile. A user can also run two scenarios in parallel and
compare the results vs status-quo.

These two scenarios are possible:

1) Replacing a data center with another
2) Improving the efficiency of one data center

## REQUIREMENTS

This app requires the following modules:

- streamlit (https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation)
- pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html)

## RECOMMENDED MODULES
